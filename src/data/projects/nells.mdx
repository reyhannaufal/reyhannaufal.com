## Project Description

---

Nells is a web application that helps people to be aware of armpit diseases, by providing information about the diseases and their symptoms. The application is built with ReactJS, NextJS, and TailwindCSS.

This project's my first time to be worked with UI/UX designer, [Rifqiandi Cesario Putra](https://dribbble.com/Rifqiandi). I'm very proud to be able to work with him ðŸ¤ž.

You can access the source code of this project [here](GitHub.com/reyhanrahman/nells) and feel free to check out the website [here](https://nellsofficial.com/).

## Product Detail

I used **React Slick** for developing the carousel on the product detail page. This feature's kinda tricky to implement because you know it's a carousel, but it's not a carousel lol ðŸ˜„.

## Leason Learned

---

Something that I learned from this project, it's important to have good communication with the designer.

Poor communication creates friction and misunderstanding between the designer and developer this leads to rework, stress, and bad relationships inside the team â›”

Using CMS will be great for this project because it will be easier to manage the content. But I'm not implementing it because:

1. It's not a scalable project ðŸ”´
2. I don't have the time to implement the feature. It will take time to do some research about what kind of CMS is suitable for this project and how to implement CMS itself ðŸ¤•.
