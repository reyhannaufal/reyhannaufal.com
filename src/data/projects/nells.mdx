## Project Description

Nells is a web application that helps people to be aware of armpit diseases, by providing information about the diseases and their symptoms. The application is built with ReactJS, NextJS, and TailwindCSS. This project's my first time to be worked with UI/UX designer, he is a friend of mine called Rifqiandi Cesario Putra. I'm very proud to be able to work with him.

You can access the source code of this project [here](github.com/reyhanrahman/nells) and feel free to check out the website [here](https://nells.netlify.app/). If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/reyhan-naufal).

## Product Detail

I used **React Slick** for developing the carousel on the product detail page

## Leason Learned

Something that I learned from this project is, that it's important to have good communication with the designer because every pixel matters to him. Overall working with Rifqi is such a great experience.

Using CMS will be great for this project because it will be easier to manage the content. But I'm not implementing it because:

1. I don't have the time to do so
2. It's just one time use-only application.
